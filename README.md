# Ray Tracing Project

This project involves ray tracing implementation in C++ to generate realistic images through simulating the behavior of light. Ray tracing is a rendering technique used to generate images by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects in a scene.The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of the concepts discussed in the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
